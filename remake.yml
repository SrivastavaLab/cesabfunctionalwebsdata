## or should i give the original downloads a "clean" step, so that I could just delete them all and remake it again?

  ## obtain all the data

  dats:
    command: bwg_get(I("datasets"))

  visits:
    command: bwg_get(I("visits"))

  broms:
    command: bwg_get(I("bromeliads"))

  spp:
    command: bwg_get(I("species"))

  trts:
    command: bwg_get(I("species"), I(list(traits = "true")))


# moving down
  final:
    command: I(1)
